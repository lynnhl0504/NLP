# NLP
#“Natural language processing” project (Python) consists of 
#Word Segmentation, 
#Phrasal Chunking, 
#Word Alignment, 
#Translation Decoding and 
#Automatic Evaluation 
#which respectively focus on restoring missing word boundaries, 
#identifying non-recursive syntactic groups of words, 
#identifying alignments between words from two different languages, 
#generating the most probable translations that can be found and making judgements on the 
#best existing translation automatically.
